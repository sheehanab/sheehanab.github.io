## Portfolio

### School Projects:
#### <a href="https://maxdoerr.wixsite.com/timeslesstech" target="_blank">Timeless Tickets</a>
I worked with a team to create a website to refine the ticketing system used by sororities and fraternities at their philanthropy events. <br/>
*Accompanying documentation to follow* <br/>
*Created: Fall 2018*

#### [Student Scheduler](TBA)
I collaborated with a team in my Introduction to Database System Design class to create a site that allows students to create a schedule of assignments and their due dates and collaborate, so that they are able to stay on track and take charge of their education. <br/>

*Created: Fall 2019*


### Personal/Work Projects:
#### <a href="https://sites.google.com/kent.edu/ksu-irc/home" target="_blank">Instructional Resource Center Employee Hub</a>
I created a Google Site to clearly store needed employee information. It is easily searchable, and access to the actual site is restricted to staff members only. On this site, some documents and pages may be restricted to keep company information private. 
*Created Spring 2019*

#### [Need to find additional project]()
I still need to find an additional out of class project.
