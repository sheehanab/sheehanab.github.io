#### **Student Scheduler**
I collaborated with a team in my Introduction to Database System Design class to create a site that allows students to create a schedule of assignments and their due dates and collaborate, so that they are able to stay on track and take charge of their education. <br>
Use username: "test" and password: "test" for a student login, and username: "testinstructor" and password: "test" for an instructor login.<br/>

### Personal/Work Projects:
------
#### **Instructional Resource Center Employee Hub**
I created a Google Site to clearly store needed employee information. It is easily searchable, and access to the actual site is restricted to staff members only. On this site, some documents and pages may be restricted to keep company information private. <br/>
